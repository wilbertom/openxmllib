openxmllib-py3
==========

This is a fork of [openxmllib](https://github.com/glenfant/openxmllib)
with Python3 support.

openxmllib is a set of tools that deals with the new ECMA 376 office file
formats known as OpenXML.

http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm

OpenXML format is used by Microsoft Office 2007 and later. Apple iWork
and OpenOffice have filters to use this format too, starting from iWork'08
and OO version 2.2.

Features
========

Tested features
---------------

* Extract words from a document for indexing purpose.
* Get metadata from a document
* Add OpenXml mimetypes to standard ``mimetypes`` module.
* Extract cover thumbnail image, if the document contains it

Planned features
----------------

* Transform a document to HTML

Public API
==========

These examples say all::

  >>> import openxmllib
  >>> doc = openxmllib.openXmlDocument(path='office.docx')
  >>> # Raises a ValueError on not supported office files.
  >>> doc.mimeType
  'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document'
  >>> doc.coreProperties # Keys may depend on application
  {'title': u'blah...', u'creator': u'John Doe', ...}
  >>> doc.extendedProperties # Keys may depend on application
  {'Words': u'312', 'Application': u'Your favorite word processor', ...}
  >>> doc.customProperties # May return an empty mapping
  {'My property': u'My value', ...}
  >>> doc.allProperties # Merges core+extended+custom properties (see above)
  {...}
  >>> doc.indexableText(include_properties=False)
  u'all the words of that document body'
  >>> doc.indexableText(include_properties=True)
  u'all the words of that document body and all properties values'
  >>> doc.documentCover()
  ('jpg', <open file '/var/folders/.../docProps/thumbnail.jpeg', mode 'rb' at 0x1af300>)

Standard ``mimetypes`` package extensions ::

  >>> import mimetypes
  >>> mimetypes.guess_type('somedoc.docx')
  ('application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', None)
  >>> mimetypes.guess_type('somecalc.xlsx')
  ('application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet', None)
  >>> mimetypes.guess_type('someslides.pptx')
  ('application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation', None)

Document factory signatures::

  >>> # We have the path for the office file
  >>> doc = openxmllib.openXmlDocument(path='office.docx')
  >>> # We have a file object for the office file
  >>> fh = open('office.docx', 'rb')
  >>> doc = openxmllib.openXmlDocument(file_='office.docx')
  >>> # We have the URL for the office file
  >>> doc = openxmllib.openXmlDocument(url='http://domain.tld/office.docx')
  >>> # Xe have the raw data of the office file
  >>> import mimetypes
  >>> docx_mimetype = mimetypes.guess_type('office.docx')
  >>> body = open('office.docx', 'rb').read()
  >>> doc = open(data=body, mime_type=docx_mimetype)

Note that if you're not running a Python application, you may get the indexable
text from a document with the `openxmlinfo.py` console utility. Just type::

  $ openxmlinfo --help

Status
======


Starting from version 2.0, this package is tested using Python 3.8.x on Linux.
If dependencies can be met, it will most likely work on other environments as well.

Installation
============

Using the usual setuptools command::

  $ pip install openxmllib-py3

Note that this will install the excellent `lxml` egg too if not already done.

From now you can "import openxmllib" in your Python apps and use the
"openxmlinfo" command line utility.

Gotchas
=======

Be aware that most text data coming from the various openxmllib
services might be us-ascii or Unicode. This is a side effect of lxml
(bug or feature ?). It's up to your application to convert these texts
to the appropriate charset.

We do not actually handle exceptions due to malformed XML or various
unexpected structures. You should handle the various (potential)
problems in a try (...) except (...) block in your application.

Developing and testing
======================

You should grab openxmllib from its `repository at https://github.com/wilbertom/openxmllib-py3`_.

Then::

  $ cd /where/you/installed/openxmllib
  $ python setup.py develop

Note that testing does not require the installation::

  $ cd tests
  $ python runalltests.py
